# Created a dynamic blogging website that retrieves blog data from a local JSON file and displays it on the website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JSON.

### Dynamic Website:
A dynamic website refers to a web application that can change its content, structure, and behavior based on user interactions, time, or other factors. Unlike static websites, which serve pre-defined HTML pages, dynamic websites can generate content on-the-fly, allowing for a more interactive and personalized experience. Dynamic websites often rely on server-side processing (e.g., PHP, Node.js) or client-side scripting (e.g., JavaScript) to modify the Document Object Model (DOM) and update the user interface accordingly.

### JSON File: 
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application, or between different parts of a web application. In the context of a dynamic blogging website, a JSON file could store structured data representing blog posts, including metadata like titles, authors, publication dates, and the actual content. This data can then be loaded into the website and displayed to users.

### Bootstrap: 
Bootstrap is a popular open-source framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. It provides a set of reusable HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components that developers can use to quickly build user interfaces. Bootstrap's grid system allows for flexible layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring that the website looks good on both desktop computers and mobile devices. Additionally, Bootstrap offers pre-designed styles for typography, buttons, forms, navigation, and other common web elements, which can significantly speed up the development process. By using Bootstrap, developers can create visually appealing and functional websites with less code and effort compared to building everything from scratch.
